## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Module not found" error
- **Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: API key error
- **Solution**: Check your `.env` file has the correct `GROQ_API_KEY`

**Issue**: PDF extraction fails
- **Solution**: Ensure PDFs contain actual text (not just images/scans)

**Issue**: Charts not displaying
- **Solution**: Check internet connection (Chart.js loads from CDN)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your Groq API key private
- The application doesn't store uploaded files permanently
- All processing happens server-side
